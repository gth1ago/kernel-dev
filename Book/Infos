Compilling Kerner Version

By default, gcc on your system may look for the kernel headers in their default location 
    rather than where you installed the new copy of the kernel (usually in /usr/src/. 
    This can be fixed by using gcc's -I switch.

----------------------------------------------------

Kernel Modules work a bit differently of program usually. A module always beegin with either the 
init_module or the function you specify with module_init call. This is the entry function for modules;
it tells the kernel what functionality the module provides and sets up the kernel to run the module's
function when they're needed. Once it does this, entry functionn returns and the module does nothing 
until the kernel wants to do something with the code that the module provides

All modules end by calling either cleanup_module or the function you specify with the module_exit call.
It undoes whatever entry function did. It unregisters the functionalit what the entry function registered.

Every module must have an entry function and an exit function.
